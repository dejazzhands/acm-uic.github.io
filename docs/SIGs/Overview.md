# SIGs Overview

Special Interest Groups (SIGs) exist to provide a way for the ACM to help students learn about, discuss, or collaborate on relevant topics concerning the ACM’s purpose as stated in section 2.

Any member of the ACM in good standing may start a SIG.

SIGs must hold meetings at least once every two weeks. Failure to hold these meetings shall be considered misconduct on behalf of the SIG and gives the Council cause for the SIG’s dissolution.
SIGs are not expected to hold meetings during any of the summer semesters nor any day that the University is not holding classes.

The ACM Council may pass a Decision to dissolve a SIG should they have cause due to misconduct on the part of a SIG. The nature of this misconduct is left to the discretion of the ACM Council.
